The codebase was initially released by Google in 2019, but the project was suspended in 2021. Starting in 2023, (from commit https://github.com/refraction-ray/TensorNetwork-NG/commit/e12580f1749493dbe05f474d2fecdec4eaba73c5) @refraction-ray began contributing to the package's maintenance under the name tensornetwork-ng. Due to limited resources and effort, only several essential submodules were included in the first stage.
